# Oxford Hack 2020 - MATLAB, Unity Game, and Augmented Reality

# View our MATLAB application source codes!


# View our Unity Game application source codes!


# View the AR visualization of the components!

  • **components** - AR visualization of the components in the circuit with a resistor
  
  • **components2** - AR visualization of the components in the circuit with a bulb
  
  
  
  
# How we tackled the selected challenges

  • **MathWorks** - 
  
  • **echoAR** - utilized echoAR by generating models/components, importing them into Reality Composer, and assembling them into a circuit
